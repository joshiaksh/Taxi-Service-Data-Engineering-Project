# Taxi-Service-Data-Engineering-Project

Project Description: Taxi Service Data Engineering and Analytics with Python, Mage.ai, BigQuery, and Dashboards.
This project explores the world of taxi service data, utilizing advanced data engineering and analytics techniques. Leveraging data from Uber, we'll embark on a comprehensive journey that spans data wrangling, modeling, analysis, and visualization.

Objective: Improve the efficiency and quality of taxi services by leveraging data-driven insights from Uber's dataset. 

Scope: Analyze trip data, driver behavior, customer feedback, and other relevant metrics to identify areas for improvement.

Key Highlights:

Data Source: Utilize real-world trip data from Uber, providing valuable insights into taxi service operations.

Data Modeling: Craft a robust data model based on the raw data structure, ensuring efficient storage and analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employ Python to dive into the data, uncovering hidden patterns and trends.

Data Pipeline Construction: Integrate Mage.ai, a powerful pipeline automation tool, to streamline data loading, transformation and export in Python.

BigQuery Integration: Seamlessly import and analyze cleansed data with Google BigQuery's scalable and serverless data warehouse.

SQL & Querying: Leverage SQL queries within BigQuery to unlock deeper insights and answer key business questions.

Interactive Dashboarding: Construct a compelling dashboard using Looker Studio fostering informed decision-making.
